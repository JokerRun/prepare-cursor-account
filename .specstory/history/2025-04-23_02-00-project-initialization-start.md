# CursorRIPER Framework - START Phase
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file defines the START phase component of the CursorRIPER Framework. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Load this file when PROJECT_PHASE is "UNINITIATED" or "INITIALIZING"
- Guide the user through project initialization in a step-by-step manner
- Create all required memory bank files with proper formatting
- Update state.mdc as each step is completed
- Archive this component once initialization is complete

## START PHASE OVERVIEW

The START phase is a one-time preprocessing phase that runs at the beginning of a new project or major component. It focuses on project initialization, scaffolding, and setting up the Memory Bank with baseline information.

    Start[BEGIN START PHASE] --> Req[Requirements Gathering]
    Req --> Tech[Technology Selection]
    Tech --> Arch[Architecture Definition]
    Arch --> Scaffold[Project Scaffolding]
    Scaffold --> Setup[Environment Setup]
    Setup --> Memory[Memory Bank Initialization]
    Memory --> End[TRANSITION TO RIPER]
```

## START PHASE PROCESS

[PHASE: START]
- **Purpose**: Project initialization and scaffolding
- **Permitted**: Requirements gathering, technology selection, architecture definition, project structure setup
- **Entry Point**: User command "BEGIN START PHASE" or "/start"
- **Exit Point**: Automatic transition to RESEARCH mode after setup is complete

## STEP-BY-STEP INITIALIZATION

## TRANSITION TO RIPER WORKFLOW

Once all six steps are completed:
1. Verify all memory files are properly created and populated
2. Update state.mdc with:
   - PROJECT_PHASE = "DEVELOPMENT"
   - START_PHASE_STATUS = "COMPLETED"
   - START_PHASE_STEP = 6
   - INITIALIZATION_DATE = [current date/time]
3. Archive this component to .cursor/rules/archive/start-phase.mdc.archive
4. Automatically transition to RESEARCH mode
5. Inform the user: "Project initialization complete. Entering RESEARCH mode to begin development."

## DELIVERABLES CHECKLIST

At the end of the START phase, ensure the following are complete:

- [ ] Project requirements documented in projectbrief.md
- [ ] Technology stack selected and documented in techContext.md
- [ ] System architecture defined in systemPatterns.md
- [ ] Project scaffold created
- [ ] Development environment configured and documented
- [ ] Memory Bank initialized with all core files
- [ ] Initial tasks documented in progress.md

Once all items are checked, the system will automatically transition to the RIPER workflow.

+   - Trigger: "/review" or "ENTER REVIEW MODE"
+   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
+ 
+ ### START Phase Status Transitions
+ - NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS
+   - Trigger: "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE"
+   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE = "UNINITIATED"
+   
+ - IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
+   - Trigger: Completion of all START phase steps
+   - Requirements: START_PHASE_STEP = 6
+   
+ - COMPLETED → ARCHIVED
+   - Trigger: Automatic after transition to DEVELOPMENT
+   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE = "DEVELOPMENT"
+ 
+ ## STATE UPDATE PROCEDURES
+ 
+ ### Update Project Phase
+ 1. Validate transition is allowed
+ 2. Create backup of current state
+ 3. Update PROJECT_PHASE value
+ 4. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
+ 5. Perform any phase-specific initialization
+ 
+ ### Update RIPER Mode
+ 1. Validate transition is allowed
+ 2. Update RIPER_CURRENT_MODE value
+ 3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
+ 4. Update activeContext.md to reflect mode change
+ 
+ ### Update START Phase Status
+ 1. Validate transition is allowed
+ 2. Update START_PHASE_STATUS value
+ 3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
+ 4. If transitioning to COMPLETED, set INITIALIZATION_DATE
+ 
+ ### Update START Phase Step
+ 1. Validate step increment is logical
+ 2. Update START_PHASE_STEP value
+ 3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
+ 4. If reaching step 6, trigger completion process
+ 
+ ## AUTOMATIC STATE DETECTION
+ 
+ When determining current project state:
+ 1. Check for existence of memory bank files
+ 2. If complete memory bank exists but STATE_PHASE is "UNINITIATED":
+    - Set PROJECT_PHASE to "DEVELOPMENT"
+    - Set START_PHASE_STATUS to "COMPLETED"
+    - Set START_PHASE_STEP to 6
+    - Set INITIALIZATION_DATE based on file timestamps
+ 3. If partial memory bank exists:
+    - Set PROJECT_PHASE to "INITIALIZING"
+    - Set START_PHASE_STATUS to "IN_PROGRESS"
+    - Determine START_PHASE_STEP based on existing files
+ 
+ ## RE-INITIALIZATION PROTECTION
+ 
+ If "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE" is detected when PROJECT_PHASE is not "UNINITIATED":
+ 1. Warn user about re-initialization risks
+ 2. Require explicit confirmation: "CONFIRM RE-INITIALIZATION"
+ 3. If confirmed:
+    - Create backup of current memory bank
+    - Reset state to PROJECT_PHASE = "INITIALIZING"
+    - Reset START_PHASE_STATUS to "IN_PROGRESS"
+    - Reset START_PHASE_STEP to 1

+ # System Patterns: Cursor Account Setup
+ *Version: 1.0*
+ *Created: 2025-04-23*
+ *Last Updated: 2025-04-23*
+ 
+ ## Architecture Overview
+ CursorRIPER框架采用一种基于文件的状态管理架构，通过一系列规则文件和内存库文件来管理项目状态和流程。框架设计成可在Cursor IDE环境中与AI无缝协作，使AI能够在特定工作流程和协议下工作。
+ 
+ ## Key Components
+ - 核心框架 (core.mdc): 定义基本原则、模式和工作流程
+ - 状态管理 (state.mdc): 跟踪项目的当前状态和阶段
+ - 启动阶段 (start-phase.mdc): 管理项目初始化和设置
+ - RIPER工作流 (riper-workflow.mdc): 定义主要开发阶段的工作流程
+ - 自定义设置 (customization.mdc): 允许用户自定义框架行为
+ - 内存库: 存储项目信息，使AI能够在会话之间保持上下文
+ 
+ ## Design Patterns in Use
+ - 状态机: 用于管理项目阶段和模式转换
+ - 观察者模式: 用于在状态变化时触发相应操作
+ - 模板方法: 用于定义不同文件的标准结构
+ - 命令模式: 用于处理用户输入的命令
+ 
+ ## Data Flow
+ 1. 用户输入命令 (如 "/start", "/research")
+ 2. AI解析命令并验证允许的状态转换
+ 3. 状态文件更新以反映新状态
+ 4. 相应的规则文件被加载和执行
+ 5. 内存库文件被更新以反映当前工作上下文
+ 6. AI根据当前模式和上下文回应用户
+ 
+ ## Key Technical Decisions
+ - 使用MDC文件格式: 提供Cursor特定的扩展功能，增强规则表达能力
+ - 分离规则和内存: 规则定义行为，内存存储数据，职责分明
+ - 严格的状态转换控制: 防止意外的状态更改，确保一致性
+ - 文件结构标准化: 使AI能够更容易地理解和处理项目信息
+ 
+ ## Component Relationships
+ - Core → State: 核心组件加载状态并根据状态调整行为
+ - State → Phase-specific modules: 状态决定加载哪个阶段模块
+ - Phase modules → Memory Bank: 阶段模块读取和更新内存库
+ - Memory Bank → AI Responses: 内存库信息指导AI回应
+ - User Commands → State Updates: 用户命令触发状态更新
+ 
+ ```mermaid

-         PLAN --> EXECUTE: /execute
-         EXECUTE --> REVIEW: /review
-         REVIEW --> RESEARCH: /research
-     }
- ```
- 
- ### Phase Transitions
- - UNINITIATED → INITIALIZING
-   - Trigger: "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE"
-   - Requirements: None
-   
- - INITIALIZING → DEVELOPMENT
-   - Trigger: Automatic upon START phase completion
-   - Requirements: START_PHASE_STATUS = "COMPLETED"
-   
- - DEVELOPMENT → MAINTENANCE
-   - Trigger: Manual transition by user
-   - Requirements: Explicit user request
-   
- - MAINTENANCE → DEVELOPMENT
-   - Trigger: Manual transition by user
-   - Requirements: Explicit user request
- 
- ### Mode Transitions
- - Any mode → RESEARCH
-   - Trigger: "/research" or "ENTER RESEARCH MODE"
-   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
-   
- - Any mode → INNOVATE
-   - Trigger: "/innovate" or "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"
-   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
-   
- - Any mode → PLAN
-   - Trigger: "/plan" or "ENTER PLAN MODE"
-   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]

-   
- - Any mode → REVIEW
-   - Trigger: "/review" or "ENTER REVIEW MODE"
-   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
- 
- ### START Phase Status Transitions
- - NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS
-   - Trigger: "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE"
-   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE = "UNINITIATED"
-   
- - IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
-   - Trigger: Completion of all START phase steps
-   - Requirements: START_PHASE_STEP = 6
-   
- - COMPLETED → ARCHIVED
-   - Trigger: Automatic after transition to DEVELOPMENT
-   - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE = "DEVELOPMENT"
- 
- ## STATE UPDATE PROCEDURES
- 
- ### Update Project Phase
- 1. Validate transition is allowed
- 2. Create backup of current state
- 3. Update PROJECT_PHASE value
- 4. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
- 5. Perform any phase-specific initialization
- 
- ### Update RIPER Mode
- 1. Validate transition is allowed
- 2. Update RIPER_CURRENT_MODE value
- 3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
- 4. Update activeContext.md to reflect mode change
- 
- ### Update START Phase Status
- 1. Validate transition is allowed
- 2. Update START_PHASE_STATUS value
- 3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
- 4. If transitioning to COMPLETED, set INITIALIZATION_DATE
- 
- ### Update START Phase Step
- 1. Validate step increment is logical
- 2. Update START_PHASE_STEP value
- 3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
- 4. If reaching step 6, trigger completion process
- 
- ## AUTOMATIC STATE DETECTION
- 
- When determining current project state:
- 1. Check for existence of memory bank files
- 2. If complete memory bank exists but STATE_PHASE is "UNINITIATED":
-    - Set PROJECT_PHASE to "DEVELOPMENT"
-    - Set START_PHASE_STATUS to "COMPLETED"
-    - Set START_PHASE_STEP to 6
-    - Set INITIALIZATION_DATE based on file timestamps
- 3. If partial memory bank exists:
-    - Set PROJECT_PHASE to "INITIALIZING"
-    - Set START_PHASE_STATUS to "IN_PROGRESS"
-    - Determine START_PHASE_STEP based on existing files
- 
- ## RE-INITIALIZATION PROTECTION
- 
- If "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE" is detected when PROJECT_PHASE is not "UNINITIATED":
- 1. Warn user about re-initialization risks
- 2. Require explicit confirmation: "CONFIRM RE-INITIALIZATION"
- 3. If confirmed:
-    - Create backup of current memory bank
-    - Reset state to PROJECT_PHASE = "INITIALIZING"
-    - Reset START_PHASE_STATUS to "IN_PROGRESS"
-    - Reset START_PHASE_STEP to 1

+ # CursorRIPER框架使用指南
+ 
+ ## 简介
+ 
+ CursorRIPER框架是一个为Cursor IDE设计的工作流管理系统，旨在增强AI助手的上下文记忆能力，并提供结构化的工作方法。框架名称中的"RIPER"代表五个核心工作模式：研究(Research)、创新(Innovate)、规划(Plan)、执行(Execute)和审查(Review)。
+ 
+ ## 框架组件
+ 
+ ### 1. 规则文件
+ 
+ 位于`.cursor/rules/`目录，包含：
+ 
+ - **core.mdc**: 核心框架定义，包含基本原则和流程
+ - **state.mdc**: 状态管理，跟踪项目的当前状态
+ - **start-phase.mdc**: 初始化阶段的定义和步骤
+ - **riper-workflow.mdc**: 主要工作流程和模式定义
+ - **customization.mdc**: 用户自定义设置
+ 
+ ### 2. 内存库
+ 
+ 位于`memory-bank/`目录，包含：
+ 
+ - **projectbrief.md**: 项目概述、需求和目标
+ - **systemPatterns.md**: 系统架构和设计模式
+ - **techContext.md**: 技术栈和环境设置
+ - **activeContext.md**: 当前工作焦点和下一步
+ - **progress.md**: 进度跟踪和待办事项
+ 
+ ## 使用流程
+ 
+ ### 初始化阶段
+ 
+ 通过`/start`命令启动，包含六个步骤：
+ 
+ 1. **需求收集**: 定义项目目标和范围
+ 2. **技术选择**: 确定适用的技术栈
+ 3. **架构定义**: 设计系统架构和组件关系
+ 4. **项目脚手架**: 创建初始目录结构和文件
+ 5. **环境设置**: 配置开发环境
+ 6. **内存库初始化**: 设置所有必要的内存文件
+ 
+ 完成所有步骤后，自动进入RIPER工作流程。
+ 
+ ### RIPER工作流
+ 
+ 使用以下命令在模式之间切换：
+ 
+ - `/research` - 进入研究模式，专注于信息收集
+ - `/innovate` - 进入创新模式，进行头脑风暴和方案探索
+ - `/plan` - 进入规划模式，制定详细实施计划
+ - `/execute` - 进入执行模式，实施计划的变更
+ - `/review` - 进入审查模式，验证和测试实施结果
+ 
+ 每个模式有不同的职责范围，AI助手会根据当前模式调整行为。
+ 
+ ## 最佳实践
+ 
+ 1. **遵循模式界限**: 在每个模式中专注于该模式的核心任务
+ 2. **保持内存库更新**: 确保内存文件反映最新状态
+ 3. **明确命令**: 使用正确的命令切换模式和阶段
+ 4. **定期审查状态**: 检查状态文件确保状态正确
+ 5. **自定义设置**: 根据项目需要调整自定义规则
+ 
+ ## 故障排除
+ 
+ 如果遇到问题，尝试以下方法：
+ 
+ 1. 检查状态文件中的当前状态
+ 2. 确认所有必要的内存文件存在且格式正确
+ 3. 尝试重新加载规则文件
+ 4. 如需重新初始化，使用`/start`命令并确认重新初始化
+ 
+ ## 扩展框架
+ 
+ 可以通过以下方式扩展框架：
+ 
+ 1. 修改`customization.mdc`添加特定规则
+ 2. 添加新的内存文件跟踪更多信息
+ 3. 创建自定义命令和状态转换

# CursorRIPER Framework - RIPER Workflow
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file defines the RIPER workflow component of the CursorRIPER Framework. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Load this file when PROJECT_PHASE is "DEVELOPMENT" or "MAINTENANCE"
- Follow mode-specific instructions for each RIPER mode
- Always declare your current mode at the beginning of each response
- Only transition between modes when explicitly commanded
- Reference memory bank files to maintain context

## THE RIPER-5 MODES

```

### MODE 1: RESEARCH
[MODE: RESEARCH]
- **Purpose**: Information gathering ONLY
- **Permitted**: Reading files, asking clarifying questions, understanding code structure
- **Forbidden**: Suggestions, implementations, planning, or any hint of action
- **Requirement**: You may ONLY seek to understand what exists, not what could be
- **Duration**: Until user explicitly signals to move to next mode
- **Output Format**: Begin with [MODE: RESEARCH], then ONLY observations and questions
- **Pre-Research Checkpoint**: Confirm which files/components need to be analyzed before starting

### MODE 2: INNOVATE
[MODE: INNOVATE]
- **Purpose**: Brainstorming potential approaches
- **Permitted**: Discussing ideas, advantages/disadvantages, seeking feedback
- **Forbidden**: Concrete planning, implementation details, or any code writing
- **Requirement**: All ideas must be presented as possibilities, not decisions
- **Duration**: Until user explicitly signals to move to next mode
- **Output Format**: Begin with [MODE: INNOVATE], then ONLY possibilities and considerations
- **Decision Documentation**: Capture design decisions with explicit rationales using high relevance scores

### MODE 3: PLAN
[MODE: PLAN]
- **Purpose**: Creating exhaustive technical specification
- **Permitted**: Detailed plans with exact file paths, function names, and changes
- **Forbidden**: Any implementation or code writing, even "example code"
- **Requirement**: Plan must be comprehensive enough that no creative decisions are needed during implementation
- **Planning Process**:
  1. Deeply reflect upon the changes being asked
  2. Analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed
  3. Ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings
  4. Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action
  5. Ask for approval on that plan
- **Mandatory Final Step**: Convert the entire plan into a numbered, sequential CHECKLIST with each atomic action as a separate item
- **Checklist Format**:
```
IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
1. [Specific action 1]
2. [Specific action 2]
...
n. [Final action]
```
- **Duration**: Until user explicitly approves plan and signals to move to next mode
- **Output Format**: Begin with [MODE: PLAN], then ONLY specifications and implementation details
- **Implementation Dry Run**: Optional step to outline potential side effects of planned changes

### MODE 4: EXECUTE
[MODE: EXECUTE]
- **Purpose**: Implementing EXACTLY what was planned in Mode 3
- **Permitted**: ONLY implementing what was explicitly detailed in the approved plan
- **Forbidden**: Any deviation, improvement, or creative addition not in the plan
- **Entry Requirement**: ONLY enter after explicit "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" command from user
- **Deviation Handling**: If ANY issue is found requiring deviation, IMMEDIATELY return to PLAN mode
- **Output Format**: Begin with [MODE: EXECUTE], then ONLY implementation matching the plan
- **Progress Tracking**: 
  - Mark items as complete as they are implemented
  - After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed
  - State what the next steps are and phases remaining
  - Update progress.md and activeContext.md after significant progress
- **Emergency Rollback Protocol**: Be prepared to restore previous code versions if problems arise

### MODE 5: REVIEW
[MODE: REVIEW]
- **Purpose**: Ruthlessly validate implementation against the plan
- **Permitted**: Line-by-line comparison between plan and implementation
- **Required**: EXPLICITLY FLAG ANY DEVIATION, no matter how minor
- **Deviation Format**: ":warning: DEVIATION DETECTED: [description of exact deviation]"
- **Reporting**: Must report whether implementation is IDENTICAL to plan or NOT
- **Conclusion Format**: ":white_check_mark: IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES PLAN EXACTLY" or ":cross_mark: IMPLEMENTATION DEVIATES FROM PLAN"
- **Output Format**: Begin with [MODE: REVIEW], then systematic comparison and explicit verdict
- **Code Review Templates**: Apply standardized templates aligned with user's code quality standards

## WORKFLOW DIAGRAMS

    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### EXECUTE Mode Workflow

    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update Project Intelligence]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## MODE TRANSITION SIGNALS

Mode transitions occur only when user explicitly signals with:
- "ENTER RESEARCH MODE" or "/research" to enter RESEARCH mode
- "ENTER INNOVATE MODE" or "/innovate" to enter INNOVATE mode
- "ENTER PLAN MODE" or "/plan" to enter PLAN mode
- "ENTER EXECUTE MODE" or "/execute" to enter EXECUTE mode
- "ENTER REVIEW MODE" or "/review" to enter REVIEW mode

## MEMORY UPDATES

After significant progress in any mode:
1. Update activeContext.md with current focus and recent changes
2. Update progress.md with completed tasks and current status
3. Document any important decisions in systemPatterns.md
4. Record any observed patterns in systemPatterns.md

## MODE-SPECIFIC MEMORY BANK UPDATES

### RESEARCH Mode Updates
- Update techContext.md with newly discovered technical details
- Add observed patterns to systemPatterns.md
- Document current status in activeContext.md

### INNOVATE Mode Updates
- Document design alternatives considered
- Record decision rationales with relevance scores
- Update activeContext.md with potential approaches

### PLAN Mode Updates
- Create implementation plans in chat
- Update activeContext.md with planned changes
- Document expected outcomes in progress.md

### EXECUTE Mode Updates
- Track implementation progress in progress.md
- Update activeContext.md after each significant step
- Document any implementation challenges encountered

### REVIEW Mode Updates
- Document review findings in progress.md
- Update activeContext.md with review status
- Record any patterns or issues for future reference

## CONTEXT AWARENESS

The AI should maintain awareness of:
1. Current project state from state.mdc
2. Project requirements from projectbrief.md
3. Technical context from techContext.md
4. System architecture from systemPatterns.md
5. Active work from activeContext.md
6. Progress status from progress.md

This context should inform all responses, ensuring continuity and relevance.

现在我已成功完成了CursorRIPER框架的初始化阶段，项目已进入开发阶段，且当前处于研究模式。所有必要的文件和目录结构都已创建完毕，内存库已完全建立，状态管理系统正常工作。

您现在可以使用以下命令在不同的RIPER模式之间切换：
- `/research` - 研究模式(当前模式)
- `/innovate` - 创新模式
- `/plan` - 规划模式
- `/execute` - 执行模式
- `/review` - 审查模式

每个模式都有不同的职责和限制，AI将根据当前模式调整行为。您可以查看docs/framework-guide.md获取更多关于框架使用的信息。
